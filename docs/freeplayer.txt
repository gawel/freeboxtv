Freeplayer
===========

Why another player ? Homeplayer is awesome!
--------------------------------------------

I hate java. I want to keep track of already played files. I want subtitle
delay adjustment (yeah I'm trying to improve my english...)

About
-----

This player support:

- memory of the latest played file

- playlist history

- subtitles (with delay adjustment)

Start the freeplayer with the ``-p`` option::

  $ fbxtv -p [directory]

If no directory is provided then the freeplayer will start at the latest
directory displayed in the browser.

Go to your TV and connect it to the player via the freebox panel.

File Browser Controls
---------------------

- star: back (yellow arrow on freebov V5 remote)

- left / rigth: next page / previous page

Play Controls
---------------------

Standard behavior for stop/pause/forward/rewind

- star: back (yellow arrow on freebov V5 remote)

- prev: back to the beginning of the stream

- next: seek +10mn (you'd better use the info panel and use the slider)

- info: control box (seek slider, subtitle delay slider)

- mail: control box (scale, ratios)

hm, what is the key for the history... I don't remember... Well. I doesn't
matter. Check the customisation section and add it yourself!

Customisation
-------------

The configuration is in ``~/freeboxtv/config.ini``.

You can change the defaults values.

You can also add an ``aliases`` section to perform some custom command::

  [aliases]
  red = /cmds/seek/+10mn
  green = /history
  yellow = /browser?root=/Users/pervers/Movies/.p0rn/

.. warning::

  freeboxtv can't filter p0rn stuff in the history

You can find all available keys `here
